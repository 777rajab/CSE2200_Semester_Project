# CPL 2024 Interactive Scoreboard

## Problem
The Board of Executives of the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) has decided that an interactive scoreboard will be more suited for the 2024 CPL due to the absence of some fans from the games because of capacity limitations. It is the Board’s intention to engage and boost players’ self-esteem during the games and at the same time pay tribute to their sponsors by flashing their logos every time a boundary is hit or a wicket falls.
